# Blood Pressure App
This is a Xamarin.Forms app targeted to Android (I don't have Mac to build the app).

# Running the App
To run the app in Android Emulator you need:
- Have `Android SDK 11.0 (R) - API Level 30` installed.
- Make sure that you set proper IP address in `RestService`.  
Otherwise, the app won't reach API.  
See [Specify local machine address](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/cross-platform/deploy-test/connect-to-local-web-services#specify-the-local-machine-address)
